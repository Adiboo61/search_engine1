Text 2: A Walk Through the History of Books
Books have been a cornerstone of human civilization for thousands of years. From ancient clay tablets to modern digital e-books, the way we store and share knowledge has evolved dramatically.

The earliest books were written by hand on papyrus scrolls in ancient Egypt. Later, parchment and paper replaced earlier materials, and handwritten manuscripts were produced in monasteries and royal courts. With the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century, books became more affordable and accessible. This led to a rapid spread of literacy and knowledge across Europe and the world.

Books come in many forms: fiction, non-fiction, textbooks, poetry, and journals. They allow us to learn, dream, escape, and understand people different from ourselves. Libraries hold millions of volumes that tell the story of human thought and creativity.

Even in the digital age, books remain powerful. While e-books and audiobooks grow in popularity, many readers still enjoy the feel of a printed page. The future of books may change, but their importance to humanity will never fade.
