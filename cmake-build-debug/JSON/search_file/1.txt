Text 1: The Importance of Sleep for Mental Health
Sleep is one of the most essential components of human health. It affects our physical well-being, emotional stability, and mental clarity. Without enough quality sleep, the human brain struggles to function properly. Concentration fades, memory worsens, and moods become unstable.

Mental health is deeply connected to sleep. Studies show that people who consistently get less than six hours of sleep are at higher risk for anxiety, depression, and stress-related conditions. During sleep, the brain processes emotions and repairs neural connections. Without this vital time, we are more likely to feel overwhelmed and emotionally unbalanced.

Modern life often gets in the way of good sleep. Screen time, long working hours, and stress keep many people awake far longer than they should be. Creating a consistent bedtime routine, avoiding caffeine late in the day, and turning off electronic devices before sleep can significantly improve rest quality.

In the end, getting enough sleep isn’t just a personal habit—it’s a necessary foundation for a healthy mind.
